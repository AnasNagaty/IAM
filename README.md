# Project Overview

In this project, you will apply skills learned through this course to implement and enforce identity access management within AWS. You will:



## Step 1: Evaluate IAM Permissions
Implement a role structure with policies that will be evaluated and enforced.



## Step 2: Validate Roles for Permissions
Evaluate an access control matrix and restrictions to ensure that each role has the appropriate policies and permissions implemented with the principle of least privilege.



## Step 3: Evaluate Lambda Code



## Step 4: Evaluate AWS Config
Create an AWS Config rule that will alert on a policy that does not meet the organizational requirements.



## Step 5: Remidate Bad Resource
Finish this project with a visualization of organizational roles and policies.
