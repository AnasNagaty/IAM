# Project Overview
In this project, you will apply skills learned through this course to implement and enforce identity access management within AWS. You will:



## Step 1: Evaluate IAM Permissions
Implement a role structure with policies that will be evaluated and enforced.



## Step 2: Validate Roles for Permissions
Evaluate an access control matrix and restrictions to ensure that each role has the appropriate policies and permissions implemented with the principle of least privilege.



## Step 3: Evaluate Lambda Code



## Step 4: Evaluate AWS Config
Create an AWS Config rule that will alert on a policy that does not meet the organizational requirements.



## Step 5: Remidate Bad Resource
Finish this project with a visualization of organizational roles and policies.



## Step 6: Harden The Service
After applying my policy, the only files that can be upload are (jpg & PNG)



## Step 7: Planning Layer Of Defense
Lambda is the best option for building a scanning feature as it allows the user to apply computation to data as it enter or moves through the cloud and add custom logic to the AWS resources.



## Step 8: Integrating the Yara Scanning function With S3 Bucket
Add a trigger that activates the bucket-scan function whenever anything is put in the S3 bucket.



## Step 9: Scan Suspicious Files
Using the cloudwatch logs, determine and provide the detection_name that is triggered within the image files.
